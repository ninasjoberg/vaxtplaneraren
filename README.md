This is a webpage where you can search for flowers, save and organise them, it's simply a tool for planning your garden. I have, beside building the frontend and api, added all the data, taken all the pictures and made the flower and garden related icons. 

The project is located in two private repositories, one for the web and one for the api and database.

## Languages and techniques used:
### web:
